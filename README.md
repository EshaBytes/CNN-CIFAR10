# üß† CNN Implementation on CIFAR-10 Dataset

This project presents a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) developed using TensorFlow and Keras for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model is trained with data augmentation to enhance generalization and evaluated using key performance metrics.

## üìå Overview

- **Goal:** Classify 60,000 color images into 10 distinct classes (e.g., airplane, car, bird, etc.)
- **Approach:** A custom CNN architecture with three convolutional layers, max-pooling, and fully connected layers.
- **Tools:** TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

## üßæ Features

- Data preprocessing and normalization
- Data augmentation using `ImageDataGenerator`
- Multi-layer CNN architecture with ReLU and softmax activations
- Training with Adam optimizer and sparse categorical crossentropy loss
- Evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Visualization of training history (loss/accuracy plots)

## üìä Dataset

- **Source:** Built-in `cifar10` dataset from `tensorflow.keras.datasets`
- **Size:** 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes (50,000 training + 10,000 test)
